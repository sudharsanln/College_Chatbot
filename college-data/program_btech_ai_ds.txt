B.Tech AI & Data Science
This program emphasizes practical skills and hands-on learning. Students engage in coding assignments, programming projects, and lab work to develop proficiency in programming languages like Python, C, R and Object oriented programming. They also gain experience with popular frameworks and tools used in AI and DS, such as TensorFlow, Tableau and scikit-learn.
Program Objectives
This program aims at creating future data scientists and data analysts by preparing students through a semester-long capstone project where you can apply your knowledge and skills to work on a real-life data analytic assignments
The program is designed to make you industry ready by in-depth learning in basic as well as advanced Probability and Statistics, rigorous practical skills in multiple programming language environments such as Python and Java, state-of-the-art Machine Learning(ML) and Deep Learning(DL) frameworks, Extensive knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, Image, video, text and speech analysis using ML/DL and Big Data Analytics using distributed technologies.
This includes a semester-long capstone project where the students can apply their knowledge and skills to work on a real-life data analytic projects.
