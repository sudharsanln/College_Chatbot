B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering with Specialisation in IoT
Our B.Tech CSE(IoT) program is a futuristic program that is an amalgamation of several diverse disciplines including core computer science and engineering, sensor technology and cloud computing with a dash of AI ,data science and cybersecurity thrown into the mix, thus embracing the true spirit of the 4th Industrial Revolution- Industry 4.0 that is currently happening. IoT as a subject itself is a manifestation of the awe-inspiring synthesis and symbiosis of the physical and the digital world with predictions being made that by 2025, there will be 50 billion devices connected over the world wide web.
Program Objectives
The program equips the students with a strong theoretical foundation, systematic professional knowledge, and powerful practical skills in a range of fields of computing science, internet of things, security, web-technologies, communications protocols, data management and application of intelligent algorithms.
The program includes development of IoT products and services alongside the devices for sensing, actuating, processing, and intercommunication. This exposure builds a robust foundation for a range of applications in the IoT domain.
The prime focus of the program is hands-on practice and industry learning on the applications of IoT in various sectors like Energy, Retail, Healthcare, Automation, Robotic things, and Green infrastructure.
