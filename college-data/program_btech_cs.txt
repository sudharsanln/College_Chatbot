B.Tech Computer Science & Engineering Cyber Security
The Cybersecurity course offered by Shiv Nadar University (SNU) Chennai is designed to provide students with comprehensive knowledge and practical skills in various aspects of cybersecurity. The curriculum is divided into four parts: Math, Core-CSE, Core-Cyber Security, and Applications, each focusing on different areas of study. The course aims to prepare students for both industry placements and further research in cybersecurity.
In the Core-CSE courses, students gain a strong foundation in computer science and programming. They learn languages such as C and Python, as well as Object-Oriented Programming and Android App Development. Additionally, they study hardware-related subjects like Digital Design, Computer Organization, and Operating Systems. Data-related topics such as Data Structures, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, and Database Management Systems are also covered. Networking aspects are addressed through courses like Computer Networks, Network Security, Cloud Computing & Security, and Web Technologies. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques, Deep Learning, and Cognitive Psychology are taught to provide students with a foundation in AI for cybersecurity.
The Core-Cyber Security courses focus specifically on cybersecurity principles and practices. Topics covered include Classical Cryptography, Cyber Security Essentials, Modern Cryptography, System Security Management, Network Penetration Testing, Ethical Hacking, Social Engineering, Cyber Forensics, and Web Application Security. These courses provide students with an in-depth understanding of cybersecurity fundamentals, threat detection and prevention mechanisms, and the skills required to investigate and respond to cyber threats.
