Chennai has been very dear to my heart, and one of the aspects that I appreciate most is the culture of excellence in education. The high density of brilliant minds makes it a logical home for a global institution. The philosophy of “simple living, high thinking” establishes an environment where solid academic rigour and boundless curiosity go hand in hand.
